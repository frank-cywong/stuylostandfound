Lost and Found: The Website V1.2

**MOBILE-FRIENDLY (ish)!!!!**
<br>Finally made sidebar work such that mobile devices have a much easier time navigating
<br>("Sidebar" is not really a sidebar but it is essentially a nav bar on mobile)

Python database has been coded and tested, and... it works!
Only problem is that we could not find any server that could run the database for free...

Roadmap:
- Add a search function
